# Personal blog

This is my personal blog, based on [Jekyll-Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).

Some changes I've made:
- Disqus include is now fully completed with all the variables sugested [here](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472098-javascript-configuration-variables).

My name is Federico Martin Roasio, I obtained my Electrical Engineer degree at the University of Buenos Aires in 2013 presenting a thesis on Integrated Navigation Systems for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. I was awarded as the best graduated in Engineering from the University of Buenos Aires in 2013 by the National Academy of Engineering.

I'm passionate about software and firmware development. I've worked developing software in many different fields including aerospace industry, petroleum industry, real state, digital marketing and education, among others. The key to success: focus to understand the business I am working for and how can I add value to it with my work.
